									<p>
										Since the days aboard space stations are not a 24 hour light to dark cycle, an astronaut's
										circadian rythm gets thrown off after a few days. This means their biological clock will not be synchronized with
										the longer "Day" aboard the station, causing trouble on the sleeping routines of the astronauts.

											Why is stress such an important problem?

										Astronauts can't take vacations once in space, since the stay is limited time is extremely valuable. This means
										they must work and move along, making discoveries and taking care of studies that will get us closer to a deeper
										space exploration or the understanding of the universe. Astronauts must be efficient, this is very difficult and puts
										 a lot of weight on their shoulders because they have so much to do. A big pile of work is already enough to stress
										 the normal person. On top of that, austronauts deal with a <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/hrp/bodyinspace"> hostile environment </a>
											 filled with dangers that threaten their lives. It's very stressful to live outside of earth. Although it's very much worth it, stress has implications
										  on the health of the person affected by it.

											<h3>What does stress do to you?</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											Since stress is produced by the central nervous system, it is tied closely with our immune system. Scientific research
											 confirms that people with more stressful jobs seem more likely to get sick. Stress can cause headaches, elevated blood
											  pressure, chest pain, depression, and anxiety. It also causes sleep deprivation which leads to more problems. Stress has
												a negatiive effect on mood, cognition, interpersonal interaction, and overall well-being. A person who is stressed will be
												fatigued and not concentrated or able enough to do a job as efficiently as possible. Stress affects mental health, physical health, and the work of astronauts.

											<h3>Sleep Deprivation</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											According to studies, astronauts have a difficulty falling asleep and typically lose an hour of sleep per night,
											resulting on a very fatigued crew. Because of this disturbance on the circadian rythm, astronauts show a loss in cognitive performance,
											insomnia, and impairment of alertness. As they are required to mantain a high level of cognitive performance and vigilance, sleep deprivation may deeply affect their jobs.
